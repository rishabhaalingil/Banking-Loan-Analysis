# Objective
This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.
We also aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters.
# Project Highlights/Steps Followed
Hereâ€™s a rundown of the steps:
1. Data Import & Transformation
      - Started by importing loan data from Excel, then used Power Query to clean, filter, and transform the data, ensuring each metric was ready for analysis.
2. Creating Calculated Measures
      - Using DAX, I added measures for total loan amount, average loan duration, and approval rates to enable in-depth analysis. Measures allow precise calculations and empower detailed insights.
3. Advanced Visualizations
      - The dashboard incorporates multiple visuals:
        - Card Visuals for quick KPIs, like total loans and approval rate.
        - Donut & Bar Charts to categorize loans by type, status, and customer demographics.
        - Slicers for dynamic filtering, making it easy to drill down by region, loan type, or approval status.
4. Conditional Formatting
      - Applied conditional formatting to highlight key metrics, helping users quickly identify areas of high risk or performance.
5. Interactivity & User Experience
      - Incorporated tooltips and interactive filtering to ensure a seamless, user-friendly experience. The dashboard is designed to offer bank analysts real-time insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
