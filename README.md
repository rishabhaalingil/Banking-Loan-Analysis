# Objective
This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.
We also aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters.
# Project Highlights/Steps Followed
Here’s a rundown of the steps:
1. Data Import & Transformation
      - Started by importing loan data from Excel, then used Power Query to clean, filter, and transform the data, ensuring each metric was ready for analysis.
2. Creating Calculated Measures
      - Using DAX, I added measures for total loan amount, average loan duration, and approval rates to enable in-depth analysis. Measures allow precise calculations and empower detailed insights.
3. Advanced Visualizations
      - The dashboard incorporates multiple visuals:
        - Card Visuals for quick KPIs, like total loans and approval rate.
        - Donut & Bar Charts to categorize loans by type, status, and customer demographics.
        - Slicers for dynamic filtering, making it easy to drill down by region, loan type, or approval status.
4. Conditional Formatting
      - Applied conditional formatting to highlight key metrics, helping users quickly identify areas of high risk or performance.
5. Interactivity & User Experience
      - Incorporated tooltips and interactive filtering to ensure a seamless, user-friendly experience. The dashboard is designed to offer bank analysts real-time insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

The report contains two dashboards:

Dashboard 1: Summary & KPIs:
Developed a dynamic dashboard providing a snapshot of crucial metrics like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI). These metrics, tracked MoM, shed light on the trends and shifts in our loan activities.

Additionally, dived into the analysis of Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs, breaking down the data to understand the quality and performance of our loan portfolio better.

Dashboard 2: Visual Overview:
Leveraging Excel’s charting capabilities, I created visual representations such as:
- Line Charts for Monthly Trends by Issue Date
- Filled Maps for Regional Analysis
- Donut Charts for Loan Term Analysis
- Bar Charts for Employee Length and Loan Purpose Breakdown
- Tree Maps for Home Ownership Analysis
